## overview

as AI agents become increasingly autonomous, they need the ability to make payments on behalf of users, but with strict safety guarantees. sigloop provides smart contract wallets purpose-built for this new paradigm, where agents can transact within well-defined boundaries.

the core challenge was enabling autonomous payments while keeping users in control. traditional wallets give all-or-nothing access, either an agent has the private key or it doesn't. sigloop introduces a middle ground with session keys, scoped permissions, and on-chain budget guardrails.

built on the ERC-4337 account abstraction standard, sigloop eliminates seed phrases entirely. users onboard with passkeys alone, and agents receive time-bound, contract-scoped permissions that can be revoked instantly.
