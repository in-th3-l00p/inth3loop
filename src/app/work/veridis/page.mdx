## overview

every product label claims something. organic. locally sourced. certified. conflict-free. today, those claims are backed by PDFs, trust, and good faith. the infrastructure to generate and validate cryptographic proof for real world product claims doesn't exist yet.

veridis changes that. if DPP platforms are the document, veridis is the signature: a verification layer that turns unsubstantiated claims into cryptographically provable facts.

three forces are converging to make this inevitable: the EU ESPR mandates Digital Product Passports for textiles by 2027, metals by 2028, and electronics by 2029. counterfeit goods have reached $1.82 trillion globally. and zero knowledge proofs, AI document extraction, and low-cost blockchain anchoring have finally reached production readiness.

</TagList>

the core of veridis is a pipeline that takes real world supplier data (invoices, certificates, spec sheets) and transforms it into cryptographic proof that anyone can verify without exposing the underlying sensitive information.

**zero knowledge verification** allows suppliers to prove claims without revealing pricing, formulas, volumes, or customer lists. privacy isn't an afterthought, it's the default.

**AI-powered data ingestion** extracts and normalizes data from documents suppliers already have. no manual entry, no new workflows. the system meets suppliers where they are.

**on-chain proof anchoring** creates timestamped, immutable records that any brand, platform, or regulator can validate independently. no central authority required.

**universal API** lets any DPP platform, ERP system, or compliance tool pull verified data. veridis doesn't compete with existing tools, it makes them trustworthy.

## supplier-first design

the biggest friction point in supply chain verification is asking suppliers to do more work for every new client. veridis inverts this: suppliers connect once, get verified once, and are trusted by every brand and platform on the network. no reverification per client.

this approach unlocks adoption where traditional verification systems fail. instead of adding burden, veridis removes it.

## applications

veridis is designed to expand across every vertical the EU ESPR schedule covers. initial focus areas include HORECA, proving every sourcing claim on the menu with verified trust badges, and textiles & fashion, where DPP-ready supplier verification can prove certifications cryptographically without revealing supplier networks.

the same infrastructure scales into any regulated product category. we don't choose verticals. the regulation does.
